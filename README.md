TODO: Notes

These are cliff notes for functionality

Built on TargetingSystem

Multiple focus channels (targeting presets)
	So you could focus on interactables, enemy targets, friendly targets, all separately

Presents weighted results instead of only the final result for optional visualization and extendable future processing

Consider setting scan ability to local only instead of local predicted so only client updates the focus and saves server perf
